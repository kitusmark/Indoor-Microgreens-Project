## The Microgreens Project

This project aims to enable the automatic production of fresh food in high density urban areas.
The system in this repository is focused on the production of Microgreens and Babygreens.

#### The main benefits of this system are:

1. Modularity
2. Escalability
3. Data collection and data visualization
4. Very low maintenance

### Modularity

This system is focused on modularity. Everything is easily replaceable. The rack is where everything is mounted and it's treated as a production unit.

### Escalability

Each production unit is very well characterized in terms of production, costs and resources. This way you can plan your farm according to your production needs and space availability. Just add more production units and attach them to the network in order to start getting data from it.

### Data collection and data visualization

We've added Internet of Things (IoT) technology from the very beginning. In order to automate the production it's necessary to sense all the variables and control the actuators.

Each production unit is equipped with different types of sensors whose data is collected by a microcontroller and sended through a transceiver to a gateway. At the same time, the gateway sends all the data from all the production units to a server to store and analyze the information.
